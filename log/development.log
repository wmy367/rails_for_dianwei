DEPRECATION WARNING: skip_before_filter is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1. Use skip_before_action instead. (called from <class:AssetsController> at /home/young/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/rails_kindeditor-0.5.0/app/controllers/kindeditor/assets_controller.rb:4)

DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`.

DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`. (called from _normalize_render at /home/young/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/actionpack-5.0.6/lib/abstract_controller/rendering.rb:128)

DEPRECATION WARNING: skip_before_filter is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 5.1. Use skip_before_action instead. (called from <class:AssetsController> at /home/young/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.0/gems/rails_kindeditor-0.5.0/app/controllers/kindeditor/assets_controller.rb:4)

DEPRECATION WARNING: `render :text` is deprecated because it does not actually render a `text/plain` response. Switch to `render plain: 'plain text'` to render as `text/plain`, `render html: '<strong>HTML</strong>'` to render as `text/html`, or `render body: 'raw'` to match the deprecated behavior and render with the default Content-Type, which is `text/html`.
